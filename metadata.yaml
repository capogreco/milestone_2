abstract: |
  Browser-based distributed synthesis is a novel, lithe technique for co-located
  networked music performance that leverages the ubiquity, connectivity, and
  computational capacity of our personal devices to achieve multi-channel sonic
  works. It continues a lineage of historical networked and participatory music
  performance practices that make use of contemporaneous technology to agitate
  hegemonic, commodified forms of music performance ritual. The paradigm
  repurposes the substrate of the internet as its artistic materials, aligning
  the practice with the educational project of creative coding, and entangling it
  in the messy problematics of surveillance and platform capitalism. This
  research employs a critical posthumanist frame to clarify an ethical position
  from which creative work can be produced in this arena, with particular focus
  on the themes of texture, ritual, and emergence.
