abstract:
  - "Browser-based distributed synthesis is a novel, lithe technique for co-located networked music performance that leverages the ubiquity, connectivity, and computational capacity of our personal devices to achieve multi-channel sonic works.  It continues a lineage of historical networked and participatory music performance practices that make use of contemporaneous technology to agitate hegemonic, commodified forms of music performance ritual.  The paradigm repurposes the substrate of the internet as its artistic materials, aligning the practice with the educational project of creative coding, and entangling it in the messy problematics of surveillance and platform capitalism.  This research employs a critical posthumanist frame to clarify an ethical position from which creative work can be produced in this arena, with particular focus on the themes of texture, ritual, and emergence."

<!--The rationale, objectives and research questions you plan to focus on -->
# Rationale

The rationale is tripartite, with the three categories being *creative*, *pedagogical*, and *sociological*.

## Creative Rationale
To fashion a coalition of cultural and technical scaffolding such that the connective, computational, and transductive affordances of audiences' devices may be leveraged to increase the accessability of networked music performance and multi-channel sonic works.

## Pedagogical Rationale
The pedagogical rational pivots on the project's ability to scaffold cultural practices which foreground the creative control of information vectors through the infrastructure of the internet.  The logic is that by making these practices more vivid in students' cultural life-worlds, the project operates at the level of sense of belonging and identity psychology to increase students' intrinsic motivations to learn the specific digital literacies required by this repertoire.

## Sociological Rationale
- To pry open a space for play in the tightly woven normative strictures that characterises our relation to our phones.
- To help, via its *pedagogical effects*, a) cultivate a more digitally literate citizenry capable of holding public discourse to a higher level of technical sophistication; and b) increase the technology-generating capacity of diverse communities.

# Research Situation

My sonic practice of distributed synthesis inherits from a variety of cultural lineages -- see *figure 1*.  Particular importance is placed on:

- the pioneering work of Chowning in developing frequency modulation synthesis, and which led to the production of the highly impactful Yamaha DX7. [-@chowningSynthesisComplexAudio1977]
- SuperCollider -- an open source programming language and environment for digital signal processing and algorithmic composition, founded by McCartney. [-@mccartneyRethinkingComputerMusic2002]
- TidalCycles, and the efforts of McLean [-@mcleanOxfordHandbookAlgorithmic2018], Cox [-@coxSpeakingCodeCoding2013], Blackwell [-@blackwellCollaborationLearningLive2014; -@blackwellLiveCodingUsers2022], Collins [-@collinsLiveCodingLaptop2003], et al. in establishing a world-wide community of practice for live coding.
- the esablishment of the Eurorack standard for modular synthesis in the mid 90s, and the community of practice which has grown around it since then [@jenkinsAnalogSynthesizersUnderstanding2020; @bjornPatchTweakExploring2018]
- the efforts of Maeda [-@maedaDesignNumbers1999; -@maedaCreativeCode2004], Reas & Fry [-@reasProcessingProgrammingHandbook2007; -@reasModernPrometheus2018], Shiffman [-@shiffmanLearningProcessingBeginners2015; -@shiffmanNatureCodeSimulating2024], McCarthy [-@mccarthyYouMeMy2020; -@mccarthyMakingSpaceFuture2019; -@mccarthyP5js10Here2020; -@mccarthyMakeGettingStarted2015; -@mccarthyCreatingArtOpen2018], Tarakajian [-@tarakajianP5jsWebEditor2020, -@tarakajianAccessibilityImprovementsP5js2020], et al. in establishing a world-wide community of practice for creative coding
- the array of thinkers and practitioners who have, over the years, attempted to investigate, understand, and agitate our entangled relation to the telephone [@mcluhanUnderstandingMediaExtensions1994; @ronellTelephoneBookTechnology1989; @kittlerDiscourseNetworks18001990; @dolarVoiceNothingMore2006]
