MusiCoLab aims at delivering a comprehensive and efficient web platform for music learning and teaching, by building on prior research experience of project partners, as well as by investigating the integration of state-of-the-art tools in intelligent music composition, performance, and discovery within an educational context. Compared to existing relevant initiatives, MusiCoLab offers a suite of innovative tools that may be used to enhance collaboration and engagement in networked/virtual settings. These tools are sought both in the context of asynchronous student/teacher interactions (i.e., course preparation and scheduling, student assignments and self-practice) as well as synchronously, i.e., serving as groupware to facilitate live music lessons by manipulating intelligent collaborative digital artifacts.}

  abstract = {"An urgent and expert investigation into behavioral addiction, the dark flipside of today's unavoidable digital technologies, and how we can turn the tide to regain control. Behavioral addiction may prove to be one of the most important fields of social, medical, and psychological research in our lifetime. The idea that behaviors can be being addictive is new, but the threat is near universal. Experts are just beginning to acknowledge that we are all potential addicts. Adam Alter, a professor of psychology and marketing at NYU, is at the cutting edge of research into what makes these products so compulsive, and he documents the hefty price we're likely to pay if we continue blindly down our current path. People have been addicted to substances for thousands of years, but for the past two decades, we've also been hooked on technologies, such as Instagram, Netflix, and Facebook--inventions that we've adopted because we assume they'll make our lives better. These inventions have profound upsides, but their extraordinary appeal isn't an accident. Technology companies and marketers have teams of engineers and researchers devoted to keeping us engaged. They know how to push our buttons, and how to coax us into using their products for hours, days, and weeks on end. Tracing the very notion of addiction through history right up until the present day, Alter shows that we're only just beginning to understand the epidemic of behavioral addiction gripping society. He takes us inside the human brain at the very moment we score points on a smartphone game, or see that someone has liked a photo we've posted on Instagram. But more than that, Alter heads the problem off at the pass, letting us know what we can do to step away from the screen. He lays out the options we have address this problem before it truly consumes us. After all, who among us has struggled to ignore the ding of a new email, the next episode in a TV series, or the desire to play a game just one more time?

Namely, the artist explores the paradox of the popularity of these devices in an age when lives are already overwhelmed by digital surveillance. For LAUREN, she became a human version of Amazon's Alexa, a smart home intelligence for use in people's own homes. The performance lasted several days and included the installation of a series of custom-designed, networked smart devices in the homes of a selected group of people. LAUREN delves into the tensions of the smart home, between intimacy and privacy, convenience and agency, and the question of what the role of human labor in automation may be.},

  abstract = {Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad's analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr's philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity. In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of "social" and "natural" agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their "interrelationship." Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler's influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.},

  abstract = {An engaging argument about what experimental music can tell us about being human. In Experimenting the Human, G Douglas Barrett argues that experimental music speaks to the contemporary posthuman, a condition in which science and technology decenter human agency amid the uneven temporality of postwar global capitalism. Time moves forward for some during this period, while it seems to stand still or even move backward for others. Some say we’re already posthuman, while others endure the extended consequences of never having been considered fully human in the first place. Experimental music reflects on this state, Barrett contends, through its interdisciplinary involvements in postwar science, technology, and art movements. Rather than pursuing the human's beyond, experimental music addresses the social and technological conditions that support such a pursuit. Barrett locates this tendency of experimentalism throughout its historical entanglements with cybernetics, and in his intimate analysis of Alvin Lucier’s neurofeedback music, Pamela Z’s BodySynth performances, Nam June Paik’s musical robotics, Pauline Oliveros’s experiments with radio astronomy, and work by Laetitia Sonami, Yasunao Tone, and Jerry Hunt. Through a unique meeting of music studies, media theory, and art history, Experimenting the Human provides fresh insights into what it means to be human.},

  abstract = {After Sound considers contemporary art practices that reconceive music beyond the limitation of sound. This book is called After Sound because music and sound are, in Barrett's account, different entities. While musicology and sound art theory alike typically equate music with pure instrumental sound, or absolute music, Barrett posits music as an expanded field of artistic practice encompassing a range of different media and symbolic relationships. The works discussed in After Sound thus use performance, text scores, musical automata, video, social practice, and installation while they articulate a novel aesthetic space for a radically engaged musical practice. Coining the term "critical music," this book examines a diverse collection of art projects which intervene into specific political and philosophical conflicts by exploring music's unique historical forms. Through a series of intimate studies of artworks surveyed from the visual and performing arts of the past ten years-Pussy Riot, Ultra-red, Hong-Kai Wang, Peter Ablinger, Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz, and others-After Sound offers a significant revision to the way we think about music. The book as a whole offers a way out of one of the most vexing deadlocks of contemporary cultural criticism: the choice between a sound art effectively divorced from the formal-historical coordinates of musical practice and the hermetic music that dominates new music circles today.},

An intermediate proxy server pre-processes the data and transmits it to the final sonification system. The sonification system is implemented using the web audio api. We are experimenting with a set of different sonification strategies and algorithms. Currently we are testing the system as part of an interactive, guided therapy, establishing additional acoustic feedback channels for the patient. In a second stage of the research we are going to use the system in a more musical and artistic way. More specifically we plan to use the system in cooperation with a violist, where the acoustic feedback channel will be integrated into the performance.}

Our systems, built on top of Web technologies, enable novel possibilities of collective and collaborative interaction, in particular by simplifying public access to the artwork by presenting the work through the web browser of their smartphone/tablet. Additionally, such a technical framework can be extended with so-called nano-computers, microprocessors and sensors. The infrastructure is completely agnostic as to how many clients are attached, or how they connect, which means that if the work is available in a public space, groups of friends, or even informally organised flash mobs, may engage with the work and perform the contents of the work at any time, and if available over the Internet, at any place. More than the technical details, the specific artistic directions or the supposed autonomy of the agents of our systems, this article focuses on how such ‘networks of devices’ interleave with the ‘network of humans’ composed of the people visiting the installation or participating in the concert. Indeed, we postulate that an important point in understanding and describing such proposals is to consider the relation between these two networks, the way they co-exist and entangle themselves through perception and action. To exemplify these ideas, we present a number of case studies, sound installations and concert works, very different in scope and artistic goal, and examine how this interaction is materialised from several standpoints.},

GrooveMachine is aimed at kids aged 10-14, and specifically targets learners from from groups currently under-represented in computing by demonstrating CS applications that challenge stereotypes. While an observational study suggests that GrooveMachine triggers situational interest, long-term engagement with CS requires this interest to be deepened and developed. To provide an opportunity for interest development, we have implemented a browser-based GrooveMachine. This not only offers the opportunity for learners to continue their exploration of CS through creative interaction, but provides a pathway to other music and CS learning platforms where they can deepen this interest. In this paper we describe the theoretical underpinnings of interest, how it relates to CS, and how it intersects with identity. We also describe the differences between the museum and browser contexts. We detail the design and implementation of GrooveMachine in the museum and explain how we translated it to the browser, including the rationale behind our central design decisions and a discussion of our technical implementation. In this way we provide valuable insight for researchers who want to reach larger audiences by developing browser-based versions of physical installations.}

This allows conveniently modifying pitch to match any target melody, facilitates training on more modest dataset sizes, and significantly reduces training and generation times. Nonetheless, compared to modeling waveform directly, ways of effectively handling higher-dimensional outputs, multiple feature streams and regularization become more important with our approach. In this work, we extend our proposed system to include additional components for predicting F0 and phonetic timings from a musical score with lyrics. These expression-related features are learned together with timbrical features from a single set of natural songs. We compare our method to existing statistical parametric, concatenative, and neural network-based approaches using quantitative metrics as well as listening tests.},

We discuss competing constraints, in particular the creative constraints associated with the challenge of coding complex multi-device behaviors, maximizing creative freedom and simplifying complex engineering and design decisions. Based on recent experience building multi-device digital installation works, we propose an approach, the “broadcast-first recipe, ” that aims to simplify the space of creative possibilities, with a trade-off between expressive power and creative efficiency that we argue is worth adopting. We examine this approach in light of hard technical constraints such as central processing unit (CPU) and Wi-Fi bandwidth budgets, which we discuss in a concrete example. We consider how the effectiveness of the proposed approach could be further leveraged in the provision of support tools.}

  abstract = {What are the parameters that define a posthuman knowing subject, her scientific credibility and ethical accountability? Taking the posthumanities as an emergent field of enquiry based on the convergence of posthumanism and post-anthropocentrism, I argue that posthuman knowledge claims go beyond the critiques of the universalist image of ‘Man’ and of human exceptionalism. The conceptual foundation I envisage for the critical posthumanities is a neo-Spinozist monistic ontology that assumes radical immanence, i.e. the primacy of intelligent and self-organizing matter. This implies that the posthuman knowing subject has to be understood as a relational embodied and embedded, affective and accountable entity and not only as a transcendental consciousness. Two related notions emerge from this claim: firstly, the mind-body continuum – i.e. the embrainment of the body and embodiment of the mind – and secondly, the nature-culture continuum – i.e. ‘naturecultural’ and ‘humanimal’ transversal bonding. The article explores these key conceptual and methodological perspectives and discusses the implications of the critical posthumanities for practices in the contemporary ‘research’ university.},

  abstract = {Robert B. Brandom is one of the most original philosophers of our day, whose book Making It Explicit covered and extended a vast range of topics in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language--the very core of analytic philosophy. This new work provides an approachable introduction to the complex system that Making It Explicit mapped out. A tour of the earlier book's large ideas and relevant details, Articulating Reasons offers an easy entry into two of the main themes of Brandom's work: the idea that the semantic content of a sentence is determined by the norms governing inferences to and from it, and the idea that the distinctive function of logical vocabulary is to let us make our tacit inferential commitments explicit. Brandom's work, making the move from representationalism to inferentialism, constitutes a near-Copernican shift in the philosophy of language--and the most important single development in the field in recent decades. Articulating Reasons puts this accomplishment within reach of nonphilosophers who want to understand the state of the foundations of semantics.Table of Contents: Introduction 1\textbackslash.

Besides being ethically rigorous, the framework seeks to be accessible for information engineers, musicians, and the wider circle of participants in the IoMusT. The purpose is to facilitate and quicken the process of ethically designing and evaluating work at the intersection of network-based technology and musical creativity. Finally, we exemplify the framework by applying it to an IoMusT experimental performance. Beyond facilitating the ethical evaluation of technologically enhanced music, the framework also advances work in contemporary AI ethics in two ways. First, by introducing the principles of creativity and decentralization as critical to ethically exploring musical creativity. Second, by organizing the principles of AI ethics under a human-centric logic.},

In this 2002 study, John Butt sums up debates on the nature of the early music movement and historically informed performance, calling upon a seemingly inexhaustible fund of ideas gleaned from historical musicology, analytic philosophy, literary theory, historiography and theories of modernism and postmodernism. He develops the critical views of both supporters and detractors of the movement, while claiming ultimately that it has more intellectual and artistic potential than its detractors may have assumed. He also asks whether the phenomenon of historically informed performance reflects changes in the culture of western music and how it, in turn, may have influenced that culture, particularly in regard to such issues as the status of the composer, the work, intentionality and notation.},

Though the model is pre-trained with the author's local environmental sounds, the user can train the model further on their unique soundscape so that each user gets a personalized experience. After the training process, the user can listen to ambient music based on traits of the surrounding anthrophony. If the app senses less anthrophony and more biophony or geophony, then the music fades away, bringing the user's attention to the anthrophony.}

Inspired by the practices of bytebeat, these snippets are low-level expressions representing digital audio signals. Unlike existing platforms, kilobeat does not adapt existing livecoding languages or introduce a new one: players write JavaScript expressions (using standard operators and math functions) to generate samples directly. This approach reduces the amount of background knowledge required to understand players' code and makes kilobeat amenable to synthesis and DSP pedagogy. To facilitate collaboration, players can hear each other's audio (distributed spatially in a virtual room), see each other's code (including edits and run actions), and depend on each other's output (by referencing other players as variables). Additionally, performances may be recorded and replayed later, including all player actions. For accessibility and ease of sharing, kilobeat is built on Web Audio and WebSockets.}

Nevertheless, there is a lack of pre-trained models in web audio compared to other domains, such as text and image analysis. Motivated by this, we present a collection of open pre-trained TensorFlow.js models for music-related tasks on the Web. Our models currently allow for different types of music classification (e.g., genres, moods, danceability, voice or instrumentation), tempo estimation, and music feature embeddings. To facilitate their use, we provide a dedicated JS add-on module essentia.js-model within the Essentia.js library for audio and music analysis. It has a simple API, enabling end-to-end analysis from audio input to prediction results on web browsers and Node.js. Along with the Web Audio API and web workers, it can also be used to build real-time applications. We provide usage examples, discuss possible use-cases, and report benchmarking results.}

Not reducible to its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of operations. Code is understood as both script and performance, Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language--always ready for action. Speaking Code examines the expressive and performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise of social media and their actual role in suppressing political expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may seem in an era of pervasive computing.},

Many computer musicians routinely deal with problems of interconnection, unreliable message delivery, and clock synchronization. O2 solves these problems, offering named services, automatic network address discovery, clock synchronization, and a reliable message delivery option, as well as interoperability with existing OSC libraries and applications. Aside from these new features, O2 owes much of its design to OSC, making it easy to migrate existing OSC applications to O2 or for developers familiar with OSC to begin using O2. O2 addresses the problems of interprocess communication within distributed music applications.},

An amalgam of workbook and manifesto, featuring a collection of interleaved statements, diagrammatic scores, and instructional texts, Structure and Synthesis is a direct engagement with Fell's original thinking and his continual provocations in regard to "experimental" music. Alongside reflections on theory and practice, the volume includes exercises for dismantling musical expertise, habits, and intuitions, documenting Fell's explorations of the peripheries of rhythm, shape, and time in perception and performance. Long-term collaborator designer Joe Gilmore provides a striking graphic context for Fell's evolving thinking and the methods and structures he has developed through his solo and collaborative work.},

Often, a robust capability for time synchronization to less than 1 s is also required. These networks consist of specially-featured bridges that are interconnected using standard Ethernet links with standard MAC/PHY layers. Since the year 2012, this technology has advanced to the use of routers, as well as bridges, and features of interest to Time-Sensitive Net-working have been added to both Ethernet and wireless standards. Since the year 2018, TSN standardization has been expanding to include more queuing and pacing technologies, and to support new markets, such as industrial, automotive, aviation, and service provider applications.},

From the emergence and failure of the counterculture in the 1970s to the continued development of his left-accelerationist line of thinking, this volume charts a tragically interrupted course for thinking about the raising of a new kind of consciousness, and the cultural and political implications of doing so.For Fisher, this process of consciousness raising was always, fundamentally, psychedelic -- just not in the way that we might think...},

This paper introduces a paradigm whereby data points and variable parameters can be strategically mapped or bound using aliases, data types and scoping as an alternative to flat address-structured mapping. The ability to send and/or access complex data types as complete entities rather than lists of parameters promotes data abstraction and encapsulation, allowing greater flexibility through modular architecture as underlying data structures can change during the lifestyle or evolution of a computer based composition. Additionally, the facility to define data accessibility, and the ability to reuse human readable names based on a variable's scope is a common feature of most programming languages. This paradigm has been extended in that scoping a variable can be dynamically bound or addressed to specific objects, class types, devices or globally on an entire network. We describe the evolution of this paradigm through its development via various project requirements.},

Do they strive for creative perfection throughout decades of painstaking and frustrating experimentation, or do they achieve it confidently and decisively, through meticulous planning that yields masterpieces early in their lives? By examining the careers not only of great painters but also of important sculptors, poets, novelists, and movie directors, Old Masters and Young Geniuses offers a profound new understanding of artistic creativity. Using a wide range of evidence, David Galenson demonstrates that there are two fundamentally different approaches to innovation, and that each is associated with a distinct pattern of discovery over a lifetime. Experimental innovators work by trial and error, and arrive at their major contributions gradually, late in life. In contrast, conceptual innovators make sudden breakthroughs by formulating new ideas, usually at an early age. Galenson shows why such artists as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Woolf, Robert Frost, and Alfred Hitchcock were experimental old masters, and why Vermeer, van Gogh, Picasso, Herman Melville, James Joyce, Sylvia Plath, and Orson Welles were conceptual young geniuses. He also explains how this changes our understanding of art and its past. Experimental innovators seek, and conceptual innovators find. By illuminating the differences between them, this pioneering book provides vivid new insights into the mysterious processes of human creativity.},

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.},

The Web Audio API is used to dynamically mix the choir voices and give users control over sound parameters. In-browser audio latency compensation is used to keep user recordings aligned to the reference music tracks. The pitch is automatically extracted from user recordings and can then be analyzed using an assessment algorithm to provide intonation ratings to the user. The system also facilitates communication and collaboration in choirs by enabling singers to share their recordings with conductors and receive feedback. Our work, in the larger scope of the TROMPA project, aims to enrich musical activities and promote use of digital music resources. To that end, we also synthesize thousands of public-domain choir scores and make them available in a searchable repository alongside relevant metadata for public consumption.}

The urge is directed by the belief that acquiring another instrument will make one a better player. This book pioneers research into the complex phenomenon named GAS from a variety of disciplines, including popular music studies and music technology, cultural and leisure studies, consumption research, sociology, psychology and psychiatry. The newly created theoretical framework and empirical studies of online communities and offline music stores allow the study to consider musical, social and personal motives, which influence the way musicians think about and deal with equipment.

Yet the conception that there is only one—originally Greek—type of technics has been an obstacle to any original critical thinking of technology in modern Chinese thought.Yuk Hui argues for the urgency of imagining a specifically Chinese philosophy of technology capable of responding to Heidegger's challenge, while problematizing the affirmation of technics and technologies as anthropologically universal.This investigation of the historical-metaphysical question of technology, drawing on Lyotard, Simondon, and Stiegler, and introducing a history of modern Eastern philosophical thinking largely unknown to Western readers, including philosophers such as Feng Youlan, Mou Zongsan, and Keiji Nishitani, sheds new light on the obscurity of the question of technology in China. Why was technics never thematized in Chinese thought? Why has time never been a real question for Chinese philosophy? How was the traditional concept of Qi transformed in its relation to Dao as China welcomed technological modernity and westernization?In The Question Concerning Technology in China, a systematic historical survey of the major concepts of traditional Chinese thinking is followed by a startlingly original investigation of these questions, in order to ask how Chinese thought might today contribute to a renewed, cosmotechnical questioning of globalized technics.},

  abstract = {Is the future about to close in, or is it open to new horizons? For anthropologist Tim Ingold, the root of our difficulty in facing up to the future lies in the way we think about generations. We imagine them as layers, succeeding one another like sheets in a stack. This view figures as a largely unquestioned backdrop to discussions of evolution, life and death, longevity, extinction, sustainability, education, climate change and other matters of contemporary concern. What if we were to think of generations, instead, as wrapping around one another along their length, more like fibres in a rope than stacked sheets?In this compelling new book, Ingold argues that a return to the idea that life is forged in the collaboration of overlapping generations might not only assuage some of our anxieties, but also offer a lasting foundation for future coexistence. But it would mean having to abandon our faith both in the inevitability of progress, and in the ability of science and technology to cushion humanity from environmental impacts. A perfect world is not around the corner, nor will our troubles ever end. Nevertheless, for as long as life continues, there is hope for generations to come.},

We will create basic proof of concept using plain JavaScript and compare it to more advanced code based on Angular framework. All these techniques will help us write reusable structures and program music with Web Audio API. On top of that, we will look at Web MIDI API and create playable synthesizer using same declarative approach so we can perform music live. We will also touch on how using this knowledge we can create a Guitar Hero-like keys playing and Karaoke singing game which can be played directly in the browser, even on modern smartphones.}

For musicians who are socially isolated this is a valuable tool to allow musical connections despite barriers of geography or mobility. There are, however, challenges when using this technology, including how musicians cope with technical challenges (such as latency, and setting up and using NMP software), but also the challenges of communicating via potentially degraded audio and video links. By examining current research and a case study of the use of NMP at the University of the Highlands and Islands in a remote part of the UK, this paper argues that these challenges are not insurmountable. Meaningful musical relationships can be built and maintained using typical domestic equipment, and the network environment gives opportunities for musical creativity that would not be possible in a conventional rehearsal space.}

  abstract = {While the current generation of mobile and fixed communication networks has been standardized for mobile broadband services, the next generation is driven by the vision of the Internet of Things and mission-critical communication services requiring latency in the order of milliseconds or submilliseconds. However, these new stringent requirements have a large technical impact on the design of all layers of the communication protocol stack. The cross-layer interactions are complex due to the multiple design principles and technologies that contribute to the layers' design and fundamental performance limitations. We will be able to develop low-latency networks only if we address the problem of these complex interactions from the new point of view of submilliseconds latency. In this paper, we propose a holistic analysis and classification of the main design principles and enabling technologies that will make it possible to deploy low-latency wireless communication networks. We argue that these design principles and enabling technologies must be carefully orchestrated to meet the stringent requirements and to manage the inherent tradeoffs between low latency and traditional performance metrics. We also review currently ongoing standardization activities in prominent standards associations, and discuss open problems for future research.},

This chapter traces the historical development of Schaeffer’s “sound object” (l’objet sonore) and its relation to the acousmatic reduction. By modelling his research after Husserl’s phenomenology, Schaeffer developed a method for bracketing sounds from their sources and causes, the acousmatic reduction, akin to Husserl’s epoché. The acousmatic reduction permits the differentiation of four primary modes of listening. “Reduced listening” (l’écoute réduite) is identified as the mode appropriate for auditioning the sound object. A sound object is an intentional object whose essential properties can be disclosed through a method of imaginative variation. The connection between Schaeffer’s theory and his later compositions is also discussed. After a thorough exposition of Schaeffer’s phenomenology, three objections to his theory are presented concerning myth, phantasmagoria, and ontology.},

First, we introduce the creativity factors, magnitudes and constructs that are applicable to UbiMus research. Then we discuss the limitations of several models of creativity that have been laid out within the context of music education and music psychology research. The analysis points to two caveats: lack of material grounding and no support for the early stages of creative activity. Key concepts are proposed to handle ecologically grounded creative practice and everyday musical phenomena.},

Hybrid forms where DSP algorithms are implemented in both JavaScript and native C++, and distributed forms where web technologies are used only for the user interface, are also supported. Various implementation options are explored, and the most promising option is implemented and evaluated. We found that the solution is able to operate at 128 sample buffer sizes, and that the performance of the Web Audio API audio graph is not compromised. The proof-of-concept solution also maintains compatibility with existing Web Audio API implementations. The average MIDI latency was 24 ms, which is high when comparing with fully native plugin solutions. Backwards compatibility also reduces usability when working with multiple plugin instances. We conclude that the second iteration needs to break backwards compatibility in order to overcome the MIDI latency and multi-plugin support issues.}

For this application type, the QoS indicator is the mouth-to-ear delay, which should be kept under 25 milliseconds. The mouth-to-ear delay comprises signal processing latency and network delay. We propose a strong collaboration between the network and NMP applications to actively keep the to mouth-to-ear delay minimal, using direct state notifications. Related approaches can be characterized as passive, since they try to estimate the network state indirectly, based on the end application performance. Our solution employs Software Defined Networking (SDN) to implement the network-to-application collaboration, being facilitated by the well-defined network interface that SDN offers. Emulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves an improvement of up to 59\% in mouth-to-ear delay over the existing passive solutions.},

This recently proposed plugin format aims to facilitate the integration of pure native WebAudio based components, some ported from native languages like C/C++, as well as plugins written in audio DSP Domain Specific Languages. The paper will describe the complete workflow, from the Faust DSP source written and tested in a fully functional editor to a self-contained plugin running in a separate host application.}

Moreover, what challenges and possibilities arise in the development process of a novel MPO platform embracing school children as performers? In this paper, we discuss potential answers to these questions, which were integrated in the development process of mobilephoneorchestra.com. In particular, we highlight the main challenge of developing a performance platform that is both mobile and artistically rewarding, but still easily accessed by schoolchildren. Mobilephoneorchestra.com was developed as a Web Audio API to enable large-scale concert hall performances of fixed polyphonic contemporary art music. It is a kind of philharmonic orchestra for electronic sounds that embraces school children as performers and uses smart phones as instruments. Through an autoethnographic approach, our research was carried out in multiple iterations, inspired by action research. In this paper, we present findings from three iterations that include performances of music involving MPO. Schoolchildren/youths between 10 and 17 years old were addressed as MPO performers. The findings reveal both the artistic challenges of the platform and the possibilities. We specifically highlight the use of mobile music interfaces in combination with animated notation as a novel approach for an MPO concept.}

Earlier studies at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm have led to a wide range of student projects but have also indicated that there is a high threshold for novice programmers to understand and use Web Audio API. We developed the WebAudioXML coding environment to solve this problem, and added a statistics module to analyze student works. Three groups of students with technical respectively artistic background participated through online courses by building interactive, sound-based applications. We analysed the projects to understand the impact WebAudioXML has on creativity and the learning process. The results indicate that WebAudioXML can be a useful platform for teaching and learning how to build online audio applications. The platform makes mapping between user interactions and audio parameters accessible for novice programmer and supports artists in successfully realizing their design ideas. We show that templates can be a great help for the students to get started but also a limitation for them to expand ideas beyond the presented scope.}

In this work, we present a browser-based interactive app enabling sonic interaction in a virtual environment modeled after a small studio architectural design for music ideation and creation made by architects Stephan \& Eric Zimmerli, called ‘Studiolo’. We first describe our ideation and design process involving pilot testing in the New Atlantis online environment for a collaborative sound and music experience. We then describe the implementation of the ‘Studiolo’ web app prototype supported by Javascript packages (Tone, Resonance Audio, Three, and Tween) and the Web Audio API. Room acoustics is modeled using the EVERTims framework providing a real-time auralization engine for binaural room impulse response approximation. A critical analysis by one of the architects highlights the importance of multimodal factors, from visual mapping textures and lighting quality to more sensitive and responsive timbres addressing the “tactile dimension” of music creation.}

Yet Eli Maor argues that music has influenced math at least as much as math has influenced music. Starting with Pythagoras, proceeding through the work of Schoenberg, and ending with contemporary string theory, Music by the Numbers tells a fascinating story of composers, scientists, inventors, and eccentrics who played a role in the age-old relationship between music, mathematics, and the sciences, especially physics and astronomy. Music by the Numbers explores key moments in this history, particularly how problems originating in music have inspired mathematicians for centuries. Perhaps the most famous of these problems is the vibrating string, which pitted some of the greatest mathematicians of the eighteenth century against each other in a debate that lasted more than fifty years and that eventually led to the development of post-calculus mathematics. Other highlights in the book include a comparison between meter in music and metric in geometry, complete with examples of rhythmic patterns from Bach to Stravinsky, and an exploration of a suggestive twentieth-century development: the nearly simultaneous emergence of Einstein's theory of relativity and Schoenberg's twelve-tone system.Weaving these compelling historical episodes with Maor's personal reflections as a mathematician and lover of classical music, Music by the Numbers will delight anyone who loves mathematics and music.},

In this work, artist, musician, performer, and theorist Mattin sets out an understanding of alienation as a constitutive part of subjectivity and as an enabling condition for exploring social dissonance-the discrepancy between our individual narcissism and our social capacity.Mattin's theoretical investigation is intertwined with documentation of a concrete experiment in the form of an instructional score (performed at documenta 14, 2017, in Athens and Kassel) which explores these conceptual connotations in practice, as players use members of the audience as instruments, who then hear themselves and reflect on their own conception and self-presentation. Social Dissonance claims that, by amplifying alienation in performance and participation in order to understand how we are constructed through various forms of mediation, we can shift the emphasis from the sonic to the social, and in doing so, discover for ourselves that social dissonance is the territory within which we already find ourselves, the condition we inhabit.},

Until now, research and development efforts have principally focused on the exploration and validation of the concepts and on building prototypes. Nevertheless, it remains important to provide stable and powerful development environments for artists or researchers. The present paper aims at proposing foundations to the development of an experimental system, by analysing salient properties of existing computer music systems, and showing how these properties could be transposed to web-based distributed systems. Particularly, we argue that changing our perspective from a Mobile Web to a Web of Thing approach could allow us to tackle recurrent problems of web-based setups. We finally describe a first implementation of the proposed platform and two prototype applications.}

We implemented a series of prototypes—the first generation of mixDroid—for mixing using Android-based mobile devices. An exploratory field study with mixDroid was conducted inside the studio and in the locations where the sound samples were recorded. Activities happening outside the studio resulted in higher creativity scores on two dimensions—explorability and productivity. We discuss the preliminary implications of these findings for future experiments targeting aspects of exploratory creativity in everyday settings.},

Something radically new--an extraordinary rarity in musical culture--it was an instrument that used a genuinely new source of sound: electronics. How this came to be--how an engineering student at Cornell and an avant-garde musician working out of a storefront in California set this revolution in motion--is the story told for the first time in Analog Days , a book that explores the invention of the synthesizer and its impact on popular culture. The authors take us back to the heady days of the 1960's and early 1970's, when the technology was analog, the synthesizer was an experimental instrument, and synthesizer concerts could and did turn into happenings. Interviews with the pioneers who determined what the synthesizer would be and how it would be used--from inventors Robert Moog and Don Buchla to musicians like Brian Eno, Pete Townshend, and Keith Emerson--recapture their visions of the future of electronic music and a new world of sound. Tracing the development of the Moog synthesizer from its initial conception to its ascension to stardom in Switched-On Bach , from its contribution to the San Francisco psychedelic sound, to its wholesale adoption by the worlds of film and advertising, Analog Days conveys the excitement, uncertainties, and unexpected consequences of a new technology that would provide the soundtrack for a critical chapter of our cultural history.},

We created a JavaScript dialect of its mini-notation for pattern, enabling easy integration with creative coding tools. Our research pairs a formalism describing the mini-notation with a small JavaScript library for generating events over time; this library is suitable for generating events inside of an AudioWorkletProcessor thread and for assisting with scheduling in JavaScript environments more generally. We describe integrating the library into the two live coding systems, Gibber and Hydra, and discuss an accompanying technique for visually annotating the playback of TidalCycles patterns over time.}

This ironic perspective on the human condition is valuable but it cannot advance Liberalism's social and political goals. In fact, Rorty believes that it is literature and not philosophy that can do this, by promoting a genuine sense of human solidarity. Specifically, it is novelists such as Orwell and Nabokov who succeed in awakening us to the cruelty of particular social practices and individual attitudes. Thus, a truly liberal culture would fuse the private, individual freedom of the ironic, philosophical perspective with the public project of human solidarity as it is engendered through the insights and sensibilities of great writers. Rorty uses a wide range of references--from philosophy to social theory to literary criticism--to elucidate his beliefs.},

Ensuring realistic performance conditions, however, constitutes a significant engineering challenge due to the extremely strict requirements in terms of network delay and audio quality, which are needed to maintain a stable tempo, a satisfying synchronicity between performers and, more generally, a high-quality interaction experience. In this paper, we offer a review of the psycho-perceptual studies conducted in the past decade, aimed at identifying latency tolerance thresholds for synchronous real-time musical performance. We also provide an overview of hardware/software enabling technologies for NMP, with a particular emphasis on system architecture paradigms, networking configurations, and applications to real use cases.},

This paper presents the results achieved implementing 16-bit PCM stereo audio transmission on top of the WebRTC RTCDataChannel with the help of Web Audio and AudioWorklets. Several measurements with different configurations, browsers, and operating systems are presented. They show that, at least on the loopback network interface, this approach can achieve better quality and lower latency than using RTCPeerConnection, i.e., latencies as low as 50-60 ms have been achieved on MacOS.}

L. Austin, Judith Butler, the psychologist Silvan Tomkins and others—emotion in many forms. What links the work of teaching to the experience of illness? How can shame become an engine for queer politics, performance, and pleasure? Is sexuality more like an affect or a drive? Is paranoia the only realistic epistemology for modern intellectuals? Ultimately, Sedgwick's unfashionable commitment to the truth of happiness propels a book as open-hearted as it is intellectually daring.},

This interdisciplinary collection of state-of-the-art essays offers innovative and thought-provoking insights concerning contemporary philosophical and cultural reflection on the nature-culture interaction. Starting from the assumption that the binary opposition between the two terms has been replaced by a continuum of the two, the volume explores both the terms of this new interaction, and its implications. Technology occupies a central place in the shift towards a nature-cultural continuum, but it is not the only factor. The consequences of economic globalization, notably the global spread of digital mediation, also account for this change of perspective. Last but not least the climate change issue and a renewed urgency around the state of the environmental crisis also contribute to bring the ’natural’ much closer to home. Digital mediation has by now become a standard way to live and interact. The electronic frontier has altered dramatically the practice of education and research, especially in the Humanities and social sciences, with direct consequences for the institutional practice and the methodology of these disciplinary fields. This book aims to explore the implications of these complex shifts for the practice of critical thinking.},

The book considers how creative practice can lead to research insights through what is often known as practice-led research. But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders. Key Features The first book to document, conceptualise and analyse practice-led research in the creative arts and to balance it with research-led practiceWritten by highly qualified academics and practitioners across the creative arts and sciencesBrings together empirical, cultural and creative approachesPresents illuminating case histories of creative work and practice-led research},

We begin by describing the early design stage of our performance ecosystem, followed by a technical description of how the system functions with examples from our public performances and installations. We then situate our work within a genealogy of human–machine improvisation, while highlighting specific values that continue to motivate our artistic approach. These practical accounts inform our discussion of tactility, proximity, effort, friction and other attributes that have shaped our strategies for designing musical interactions. The positive role of ambiguity is elaborated in relation to distributed agency. Finally, we employ the concept of ‘feedthrough’ as a way of understanding the co-constitutive behaviour of communication networks, assemblages and performers.},

Through its ability to nurture trees, matsutake helps forests to grow in daunting places. It is also an edible delicacy in Japan, where it sometimes commands astronomical prices. In all its contradictions, matsutake offers insights into areas far beyond just mushrooms and addresses a crucial question: what manages to live in the ruins we have made? A tale of diversity within our damaged landscapes, The Mushroom at the End of the World follows one of the strangest commodity chains of our times to explore the unexpected corners of capitalism. Here, we witness the varied and peculiar worlds of matsutake commerce: the worlds of Japanese gourmets, capitalist traders, Hmong jungle fighters, industrial forests, Yi Chinese goat herders, Finnish nature guides, and more. These companions also lead us into fungal ecologies and forest histories to better understand the promise of cohabitation in a time of massive human destruction.By investigating one of the world's most sought-after fungi, The Mushroom at the End of the World presents an original examination into the relation between capitalist destruction and collaborative survival within multispecies landscapes, the prerequisite for continuing life on earth.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) is an emerging research field positioned at the intersection of Internet of Things, new interfaces for musical expression, ubiquitous music, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and participatory art. From a computer science perspective, IoMusT refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (musical things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical things, such as smart musical instruments or wearables, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. We present a vision in which the IoMusT enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel musical applications and services. The ecosystems associated with the IoMusT include interoperable devices and services that connect musicians and audiences to support musician-musician, audience-musicians, and audience-audience interactions. In this paper, we first propose a vision for the IoMusT and its motivations. We then discuss five scenarios illustrating how the IoMusT could support: 1) augmented and immersive concert experiences; 2) audience participation; 3) remote rehearsals; 4) music e-learning; and 5) smart studio production. We identify key capabilities missing from today's systems and discuss the research needed to develop these capabilities across a set of interdisciplinary challenges. These encompass network communication (e.g., ultra-low latency and security), music information research (e.g., artificial intelligence for real-time audio content description and multimodal sensing), music interaction (e.g., distributed performance and music e-learning), as well as legal and responsible innovation aspects to ensure that future IoMusT services are socially desirable and undertaken in the public interest.},

  abstract = {The availability of high-performance embedded audio systems, along with high-bandwidth and low-latency connectivity options provided by 5G networks, is enabling the Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) paradigm. A central component of this paradigm is represented by networked music performances (NMPs), where geographically displaced musicians play together over the network in real time. However, to date, IoMusT deployments over 5G networks remain scarce, and very limited statistical results are available on the actual latency and reliability of 5G networks for IoMusT and NMP scenarios. In this article, we present a private 5G IoMusT deployment and analyze its performance when supporting NMPs. Our IoMusT system is composed of up to four nodes and includes different background traffic conditions. We focused on the assessment of the sole wireless link, as the measurements can be easily transferred to a realistic NMP architecture involving a wide area network (WAN) by compounding them with those of the WAN. Our results show that latency increases with the number of nodes and with the presence of background traffic, whereas the reliability did not vary with the complexity of the conditions. For all tested scenarios, the average measured latency was below 24 ms (including a jitter buffer of 10.66 ms), whereas packet losses occurred with a probability of less than 0.01. However, irregular spikes were found for all latency and reliability metrics, which can significantly reduce the quality of service perceived by the users of NMP applications. Finally, packet loss and latency resulted to be uncorrelated, which suggests that they have different root causes.},

The adopted design approach started from an analog synthesizer, passed from its digital emulation, and returned to the analog domain via the real-time, physical control of the digital synthesizer. The prototype can be considered as an instance of a class of musical devices that allow one to give physical form to the control of virtual analog software. We present an analysis of online sources that were retrieved following the release of the prototype at an international music trade show. Overall, results preliminary validate the concept underlying the development of the prototype and reveal its potential for both digital musical instruments development and use. Benefits of the proposed class of musical devices include a higher degree of control intimacy of a plugin compared to its use with conventional interfaces such as mice and screens of desktop computers, as well as the use of audio plugins in ubiquitous musical activities.},

  abstract = {Smart musical instruments are a class of IoT devices for music making, which encompass embedded intelligence as well as wireless connectivity. In previous work, we established design requirements for a novel smart musical instrument, a smart cajón, following a user-centered approach. This paper describes the implementation and technical evaluation of the designed component of the smart cajón related to hit classification and repurposing. A conventional acoustic cajón was enhanced with sensors to classify position of the hit and the gesture that produced it. The instrument was equipped with five piezo pickups attached to the internal panels and a condenser microphone located inside. The developed sound engine leveraged digital signal processing, sensor fusion, and machine learning techniques to classify the position, dynamics, and timbre of each hit. The techniques were devised and implemented to achieve low latency between action and the electronically-generated sounds, as well as keep computational efficiency high. The system was tuned to classify two main cajón playing techniques at different locations and we conducted evaluations using over 2,000 hits performed by two professional players. We first assessed the classification performance when training and testing data related to recordings from the same player. In this configuration, classification accuracies of 100\% were obtained for hit detection and location. Accuracies of over 90\% were obtained when classifying timbres produced by the two playing techniques. We then assessed the classifier in a cross-player configuration (training and testing were performed using recordings from different players). Results indicated that while hit location scales relatively well across different players, gesture identification requires that the involved classifiers are trained specifically for each musician.},

Based on the review of the most relevant works in these fields, this paper attempts to delineate their differences and commonalities. The aim of this inquiry is helping avoid confusion between such fields and achieve a correct use of the terminology. A trend towards the convergence between such fields has already been identified, and it is plausible to expect that in the future their evolution will lead to a progressive blurring of the boundaries identified today.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) refers to the extension of the Internet of Things paradigm to the musical domain. Interoperability represents a central issue within this domain, where heterogeneous Musical Things serving radically different purposes are envisioned to communicate between each other. Automatic discovery of resources is also a desirable feature in IoMusT ecosystems. However, the existing musical protocols are not adequate to support discoverability and interoperability across the wide heterogeneity of Musical Things, as they are typically not flexible, lack high resolution, are not equipped with inference mechanisms that could exploit on board the information on the whole application environment. Besides, they hardly ever support easy integration with the Web. In addition, IoMusT applications are often characterized by strict requirements in terms of latency of the exchanged messages. Semantic Web of Things technologies have the potential to overcome the limitations of existing musical protocols by enabling discoverability and interoperability across heterogeneous Musical Things. In this paper we propose the Musical Semantic Event Processing Architecture (MUSEPA), a semantically-based architecture designed to meet the IoMusT requirements of low-latency communication, discoverability, interoperability, and automatic inference. The architecture is based on the CoAP protocol, a semantic publish/subscribe broker, and the adoption of shared ontologies for describing Musical Things and their interactions.

The 2023 GEM Report on technology and education explores these debates, examining education challenges to which appropriate use of technology can offer solutions (access, equity and inclusion; quality; technology advancement; system management), while recognizing that many solutions proposed may also be detrimental.

The system consists of a multichannel speaker-system, up to three video projections, a local Wifi network with a connected webserver and mobile devices. The audience is invited to log into the local network with their mobile devices. In the browser of the mobile devices sound and image is generated or streamed.This offers the possibility of a great diversity in the spatial distribution of sound and image. As experienced in previous projects with live audio-streaming and mobile devices the spatial gesture of music as a musical parameter comes to the fore. In the performances the audio is streamed with an icecast-server and visual output is generated with javascript on the client’s browser. The imperfection of time synchronization leads to very interesting effects. The awareness of space and the interaction of the audience with each other leads to the emergence of a social space in the concert.In addition to the dimension of space this setup also examines the relationship between different media layers. This is central for the question how to achieve 'liveness' - which in my opinion can also be achieved with this spatial arrangement and distribution of sound and image.}

By examining various aspects of music composition, including melody creation, harmonization, rhythm generation, arrangement and orchestration, and lyric writing, this paper showcases the potential benefits of incorporating edge intelligence. It also discusses the challenges and limitations associated with this paradigm, such as limited computational resources and privacy concerns. Through a review of existing AI-based music composition tools and platforms, examples of edge intelligence in action are highlighted. The survey paper concludes by emphasizing the transformative potential of edge intelligence in revolutionizing the field of music composition and identifies future research opportunities to further advance this promising domain.},

Through the ownership and control of information, this emergent class dominates not only labour but capital as traditionally understood as well. And it’s not just tech companies like Amazon and Google. Even Walmart and Nike can now dominate the entire production chain through the ownership of not much more than brands, patents, copyrights, and logistical systems.While techno-utopian apologists still celebrate these innovations as an improvement on capitalism, for workers—and the planet—it’s worse. The new ruling class uses the powers of information to route around any obstacle labor and social movements put up. So how do we find a way out?~Capital Is Dead~offers not only the theoretical tools to analyze this new world, but ways to change it. Drawing on the writings of a surprising range of classic and contemporary theorists, Wark offers an illuminating overview of the contemporary condition and the emerging class forces that control—and contest—it.},

Gamer Theory uncovers the significance of games in the gap between the near-perfection of actual games and the imperfect gamespace of everyday life in the rat race of free-market society.},

It presents an historical overview of technological innovations that were instrumental for the development of the field and discusses a number of paradigmatic musical networks that are based on these technologies. A classification of online and local-area musical networks then leads to an attempt to define a taxonomical and theoretical framework for musical interconnectivity, addressing goals and motivations, social organizations and perspectives, network architectures and topologies, and musical content and control. The article concludes with a number of design suggestions for the development of effective interconnected musical networks.},

  abstract = {Networked music is no longer a future genre: the global quarantine event of 2020 launched the concept of performing together over the Internet into the mainstream. While the demand for performing at a distance may be a new imperative, musicians find themselves faced with technological and performative processes that do not appear to be suitable for performing music together online, due particularly to network latency which disrupts the ability for musicians to synchronize. The research presented in this paper investigates and challenges the reasons why networked music is not readily embraced by musicians and describes how that might change, by way of interviews with practitioners and an in-depth review of the technical constraints. Limitations that might cause frustration are in fact shown to have creative strategies that give rise to aesthetic approaches, distinct to the platform. By exploiting the constraints, in tandem with developing technology designed specifically for remote performance, aesthetic implications arise that not only accommodate the inconveniences of latency and acoustic feedback but can help us adapt and transform how we engage in real-time online, towards a future where we can imagine performing together over even more dramatic distances such as high-latency, low-bandwidth locations outside of urban areas—or even over galactic distances.},

  abstract = {From Tim Wu, author of the award-winning The Master Switch ( a New Yorker and Fortune Book of the Year) and who coined the term "net neutrality”—a revelatory, ambitious and urgent account of how the capture and re-sale of human attention became the defining industry of our time.  ~ Feeling attention challenged? Even assaulted? American business depends on it. In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of messaging, advertising enticements, branding, sponsored social media, and other efforts to harvest our attention. Few moments or spaces of our day remain uncultivated by the "attention merchants," contributing to the distracted, unfocused tenor of our times. Tim Wu argues that this condition is not simply the byproduct of recent technological innovations but the result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. From the pre-Madison Avenue birth of advertising to the explosion of the mobile web; from AOL and the invention of email to the attention monopolies of Google and Facebook; from Ed Sullivan to celebrity~power brands~like Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump, the basic business model of "attention merchants" has never changed: free diversion in exchange for a moment of your consideration, sold in turn to the highest-bidding advertiser. Wu describes the revolts that have risen against the relentless siege of our awareness, from the remote control to the creation of public broadcasting to Apple's ad-blocking OS. But he makes clear that attention merchants are always growing new heads, even as their means of getting inside~our heads are changing our very nature--cognitive, social, political and otherwise--in ways unimaginable even a generation ago. ~ “A startling and sweeping examination of the increasingly ubiquitous commercial effort to capture and commodify our attention…We’ve become the consumers, the producers, and the content. We are selling ourselves to ourselves.” —Tom Vanderbilt, The New Republic ~ “An erudite, energizing, outraging, funny and thorough history…A devastating critique of ad tech as it stands today, transforming "don't be evil" into the surveillance business model in just a few short years. It connects the dots between the sale of advertising inventory in schools to the bizarre ecosystem of trackers, analyzers and machine-learning models that allow the things you look at on the web to look back at you…This stuff is my daily beat, and I learned a lot from Attention Merchants.” —Cory Doctorow, BoingBoing~ “Illuminating.” —Jacob Weisberg, The New York Review of Books},

  abstract = {The computer music community has historically pushed the boundaries of technologies for music-making, using and developing cutting-edge computing, communication, and interfaces in a wide variety of creative practices to meet exacting standards of quality. Several separate systems and protocols have been developed to serve this community, such as Max/MSP and Pd for synthesis and teaching, JackTrip for networked audio, MIDI/OSC for communication, as well as Max/MSP and TouchOSC for interface design, to name a few. With the still-nascent Web Audio API standard and related technologies, we are now, more than ever, seeing an increase in these capabilities and their integration in a single ubiquitous platform: the Web browser. In this article, we examine the suitability of the Web browser as a computer music platform in critical aspects of audio synthesis, timing, I/O, and communication. We focus on the new Web Audio API and situate it in the context of associated technologies to understand how well they together can be expected to meet the musical, computational, and development needs of the computer music community. We identify timing and extensibility as two key areas that still need work in order to meet those needs.},
